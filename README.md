# DementiaClassification
Comparison of Classifiers for Dementia Classification for an Enhanced Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Diagnosis 
In this project, I compared machine learning classifiers (logistic regression, random forests, support vector classifiers, gradient boosting) to classify dementia categories. 
I analyzed a longitudinal dataset from OASIS to predict Alzheimer's disease likelihood, exploring factors such as medical history and demographics. I also created graphs and tables using Python, providing insights for healthcare professionals to improve diagnosis and treatment.
